        <p>This is a hard question to answer, no matter who is asking. But it's become especially difficult for an industry responsible with providing the answers: the national press. An irony of digital media is that the Internet distributes journalism, but it concentrates journalists. Jobs at media sites like The Atlantic, BuzzFeed, or Gawker are five-times more likely to be located in New York or Washington, D.C., than television-news jobs. The clustering force is only getting more centripetal: The share of reporting jobs in Los Angeles, NYC, and DC increased by 60 percent between 2004 and 2014.</p>

        <p>It's easy to imagine many downsides of this agglomeration, like the dissolution of local reporting, but a subtler risk is that well-educated journalists in these dense cities wind up with a skewed impression of the world, a "majority illusion" based on the extremely unrepresentative cross-section of the country that's immediately around them. To be fair, being a reporter in Des Moines or rural Nebraska, while it provides a better view of Des Moines and rural Nebraska, doesn't offer a universal window into the average experiences of all Americans, either. For that, one needs something else, like a national survey.</p>

          <p>So, how useful that the Bureau of Labor Statistics recently published a report on the demographics of 29-year-olds in the U.S. As a 29-year-old reporting on the economy from New York, it was a particularly good orientation for me. The impression of young people in the U.S. today is warped: In trend pieces, the word Millennial has become shorthand for "a college-educated young person living in a city." But this usage elides some critical details, for example that most people born between the early 1980s and late 1990s (a) didn't graduate from college, (b) aren't living in a city, and (c) generally hate being called "Millennials."</p>

          <p>Instead, the average 29-year-old did not graduate from a four-year university, but she did start college; held several jobs, including more than two in the last three years; is not as likely to be married as her parents at this age, but is still likely to be living with somebody; is less likely to own a home than 15 years ago, but despite the story of urban renewal, is more likely to live outside of a dense urban area like Brooklyn or Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>Here are several more details from the BLS report (and some similar surveys) about 29-year-olds:</p>
